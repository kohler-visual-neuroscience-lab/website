My new paper "Revisiting the functional significance of binocular cues for perceiving motion-in-depth" is now available in [*Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05918-7). Very proud of this one, both adult and infant participants, multiple controls, and lots of interesting findings!
