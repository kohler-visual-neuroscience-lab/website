Prof. Kohler has published a new paper in *Symmetry*, titled [Perceptual Similarities among Wallpaper Group Exemplars](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/14/5/857), as part of a special issue of the journal focused on "Visual Processing of Symmetry". The paper was co-authored by Shivam Vedak and Rick Gilmore, and is based on data collected by Shivam Vedak in the lab of [Prof. Rick Gilmore] (https://gilmore-lab.github.io/). Shivam presented the data at the Vision Sciences Society [several years ago](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2433947) and the whole team is happy that this novel approach to studying judgments of perceptual similarities of regular textures is finally published.
