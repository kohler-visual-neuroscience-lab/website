So happy to announce that Rachel Moreau will be the first graduate student in the Kohler Visual Neuroscience Lab, starting in the fall of 2020. Rachel won an Masters Scholarship from [VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/) to study the role of symmetry in object perception and will be co-advised by the brilliant Erez Freud. We cannot wait to get started! See more about Rachel in the [Lab Members](/lab-members) section.
