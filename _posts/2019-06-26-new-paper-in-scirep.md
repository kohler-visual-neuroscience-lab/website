 My new paper "Image Segmentation Based on Relative Motion and Relative Disparity Cues in Topographically Organized Areas of Human Visual Cortex" is now available in [*Scientific Reports*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45036-y). The paper explores how object boundaries defined by motion and disparity are represented by distinct visual areas, and I find it particularly interesting that both cues elicit suppression in retinotopic cortex that extends to image locations far beyond the boundary. The data from the paper has been made available on openneuro, see links in the [data section](http://www.kohlerlab.com/data/).
