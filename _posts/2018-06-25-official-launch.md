The address of my old Drupal-based Stanford site [https://stanford.edu/~pjkohler/](https://stanford.edu/~pjkohler/) now points to my new Jekyll-based site, so I guess you could say I have officially launched my site. Still a lot to learn, but excited to have gotten this far. Next steps will be to improve and update the research section, and perhaps include some new demos.
