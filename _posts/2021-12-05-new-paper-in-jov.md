Prof. Kohler has published a new paper in *Journal of Vision*, titled [Perceived group size is determined by the centroids of the component elements](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2778130), based on data collected in the lab of [Prof. Gideon Caplovitz](https://www.unr.edu/psychology/faculty/gideon-caplovitz). In the demo shown here, the array of triangles looks smaller when the triangles are pointed outwards than when they are pointed inwards.

This, along with the series of other experiments presented in the paper, show that our visual system uses the centroid of the array elements to judge the size of a grouped array. The work was chosen for the cover of Journal of Vision, as shown here.
