Prof. Kohler has published a new paper in *Cerebral Cortex*, titled [Symmetry Processing in the Macaque Visual Cortex](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab358/6382420). We use functional MRI to measure how the visual cortex of macaque monkeys responds to symmetries in regular textures, the so-called wallpaper groups. The work was done in Benoit Cottereau's lab and led by Pauline Audurier. We were excited to see that patterns of activity across visual cortex were largely similar to what Prof. Kohler has observed in previous work with human participants, suggesting that sensitivity to symmetry may reflect a species-general mechanism.
