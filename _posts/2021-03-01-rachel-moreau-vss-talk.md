Rachel Moreau will present a talk at the Vision Sciences Society 2021 conference, titled *Differential processing of reflection and rotation symmetries in visual textures*. The talk will take place on Tuesday, May 25 during the Perceptual Organization session. This will be Rachel's first conference presentation since joining the lab as an VISTA-funded MA-student Fall 2020, and indeed the first conference presentation by a member of the KVNL. We hope to submit a write-up of the results for publication before or shortly after the talk.
