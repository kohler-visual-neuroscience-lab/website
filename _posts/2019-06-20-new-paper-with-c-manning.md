My paper with Dr. Catherine Manning was just published in [*Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929318301713). It shows how Reliable Components Analysis can be used in the time domain to extract response components that are functionally interpretable in the context of the development of motion perception.
