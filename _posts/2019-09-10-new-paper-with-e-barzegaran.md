title: "New paper with Elham Barzegaran in Journal of Neuroscience Methods"

I am a co-author on a new paper published in [*Journal of Neuroscience Methods*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027019302341?dgcid=author), my first paper in that journal. The paper was spearheaded by the brilliant Elham Barzegaran, who was my office- and lab-mate at Stanford. Elham did a great job turning our source imaging pipeline into a toolbox for realistically simulating EEG scalp data. Elham is currently doing her second post-doc at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. The paper also marks my first published collaboration with another good friend and colleague, who I also met at Stanford, [Sebastian Bosse](https://iphome.hhi.de/bosse/). Sebastian is a senior researcher at the Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications â€“ Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany.
