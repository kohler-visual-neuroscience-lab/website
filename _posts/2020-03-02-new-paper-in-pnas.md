Happy to announce that I am a co-author on a new paper in PNAS where we use steady-state EEG to measure the neural signature of approximate number sense, done in collaboration with some lovely people from Belgium and Luxembourg and led by the wonderful and talented Amandine Van Rinsfeld. Available online today: <https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/28/1917849117>
