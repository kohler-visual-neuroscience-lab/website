The Kohler Visual Neuroscience Laboratory attended the [Lake Ontario Visionary Establishment Conference (LOVE), February 9th-10th, 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/loveconference/home). The lab presented four posters at the conference, led by Shenoa Ragavaloo, Yara Iskandar, Shaya Samet and Dennis Padilla. This was the first time attending the conference for everyone, but we were thrilled to discover that such a high-quality conference takes place less than two hours from Toronto. We had a great time, and the presenters, three of which are undergraduate students, especially enjoyed the opportunity to meet and engage with their local visual and cognitive neuroscience community. Everyone's presentation went extremely well, and Shaya Samet won the 2nd best poster prize in a vote among attendees! This is a remarkable achievement, especially as the quality of posters was very high, and will surely give all of us a boost as we embark on the rest of 2023. Posters are available for download at the [Publications](https://www.kohlerlab.com/pubs/) page.
