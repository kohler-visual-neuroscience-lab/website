title: "New paper in Current Biology: Shared representational structure between visual and auditory brain regions"

Prof. Kohler has published a new paper in *Current Biology*, titled [Visual and auditory brain areas share a representational structure that supports emotion perception](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01283-5). We show that the auditory and visual parts of the brain represent emotional music and movement in comparable terms. The study was lead by [Dr. Beau Sievers](http://beausievers.com/) and began when Sievers and Kohler were both graduate students at Dartmouth College. The fact that it is finally published is due to the creative, rigorous and tireless effort by Sievers - amazing to see!
