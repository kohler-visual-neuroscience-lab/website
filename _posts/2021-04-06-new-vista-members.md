We are happy to welcome three collaborators of the Kohler Visual Neuroscience Laboratory as [VISTA affiliate members](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/researchers/affiliate-members/): Sebastian Bosse, Gideon Caplovitz and Alasdair Clarke. Affiliate Membership with VISTA offers various benefits and opportunities to work in collaboration with VISTA members and partners, including the opportunity to apply for funding opportunities through collaborations with VISTA Core members (such as Professor Kohler). We would look forward to seeking VISTA support for our ongoing collaborations with these brilliant people.
