The [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) funded the Kohler Visual Neuroscience Lab's **Discovery** grant titled *Symmetry as a cue to object and scene representations in human visual cortex*. This was the KVNL's first experience with applying for external funding in Canada, and the experience was very straightforward. Looking forward to new discoveries!
