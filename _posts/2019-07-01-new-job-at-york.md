title: "New Job, Assistant Professor at York University, Toronto"
date: 2019-07-01

I have started my new position in the Department of Psychology at York University in Toronto, as assistant professor in Visual Neuroscience. I will be affiliated with York's excellent Centre for Vision Research (http://cvr.yorku.ca) and a core member of the equally excellent VISTA: Vision Science to Applications (http://vista.info.yorku.ca) program. I will also be running the *Kohler Visual Neuroscience Lab* (KVNL), and would love to hear from students who might want to pursue graduate work in my lab, as well as undergraduate students at York who are interested in learning about using EEG and functional MRI to study the human visual system. I am so excited to get going!
