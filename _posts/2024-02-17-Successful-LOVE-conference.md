The Kohler Visual Neuroscience Laboratory attended the [Lake Ontario Visionary Establishment Conference (LOVE), February 8th-9th, 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/loveconference/home). The lab presented four posters at the conference, led by graduate students Sara Chaparian, Yara Iskandar, Shaya Samet, Shenoa Ragavaloo and undergraduate student Nikan Movahedi. As usual, we had lots of fun at the conference, and everyone's presentation was well-received. At the conference, Prof. Kohler agreed to join the organizing committee, along with [Asaf Gilboa](https://www.gilboalab.ca/) from University of Toronto and [Karen Campbell](https://www.brockcnalab.com/) from Brock University.
