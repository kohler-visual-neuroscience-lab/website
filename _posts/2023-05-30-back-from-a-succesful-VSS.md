The Kohler Visual Neuroscience Laboratory have returned from the [Vision Sciences Society conference, May 19th-24th, 2023](https://www.visionsciences.org). The lab presented one talk and three posters at the conference, led by Yara Iskandar, Shaya Samet, Mohammad Shams, and Prof. Kohler. Yara was awarded the VSS travel award to support her attendance at the conference. Unfortunately, Mohammad could not attend in-person because of shamefully long delays in processing the visas that Iranian Citizens need to enter the United States - his poster was presented by Prof. Patrick Cavanagh and Prof. Kohler. Yara and Shaya attended the conference for the first time and had an amazing time meeting the vision science community. Prof. Kohler attended for the first time in-person since 2019, and celebrated his 15th anniversary of going to VSS (first time: 2008). Posters and talks are available for download at the [Publications](https://www.kohlerlab.com/pubs/) page.
