The Kohler Visual Neuroscience Laboratory has received a [research grant](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/opportunities/research-grants/) from the Vision Science to Applications (VISTA) program for a project titled “Marmoset Responses to Mid-level Visual Features investigated with Natural and Artificial Stimuli”, which is a collaboration with Prof. Liya Ma at York University and [Prof. Dirk Bernhard-Walther](https://www.bwlab.org/) of University of Toronto. The project will use multi-unit recordings, done in the lab of Prof. Ma, to investigate how neurons in marmoset monkeys respond to symmetries in textures, naturalistic 3D objects and natural scene stimuli. We are hugely excited by the prospect of comparing the EEG and fMRI respomnses we have measured in humans and macaques, to the activity of individual neurons in the marmoset brain.
