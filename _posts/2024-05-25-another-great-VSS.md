The Kohler Visual Neuroscience Laboratory once again attended the [Vision Sciences Society conference, May 17th-22nd, 2024](https://www.visionsciences.org). The lab presented one talk and four posters at the conference, led by Nikan Movahedi, Yara Iskandar, Shaya Samet, Shenoa Ragavaloo and Mohammad Shams. Nikan Movahedi attended VSS for the first time, and opened the conference with a talk at 8 am Saturday morning - nervous times, but Nikan did a great job. Mohammad was for the second year in a row prevented from presenting his poster in person, because of VISA issues, so his poster on Monday was presented by Prof. Kohler. Everyone else presented on Tuesday, during the perceptual organization poster session, and it was fun to take part in such a lively and well-attended session, packed with interesting work. Posters and talks are available for download at the [Publications](https://www.kohlerlab.com/pubs/) page.
