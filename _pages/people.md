<a class="box-head">Peter J. Kohler</a>
<p class="box-body"><img class="small-image" src="/assets/pjkohler.png" alt="Peter">Peter is originally from Denmark, but have lived and worked in North America since 2007. He received his PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience in 2013 from Dartmouth College, before becoming a post-doctoral scholar at Stanford University, working with Professor Tony Norcia. He joined York University as an Assistant Professor in 2019. He is a Core Member of [Vision: Science to Applications (VISTA)](http://vista.info.yorku.ca/) and a member of the [Center for Vision Research](http://cvr.yorku.ca/) at York University.

<a class="box-head">Rachel Moreau</a>
<p class="box-body"><img class="small-image" src="/assets/rmoreau.png" alt="Rachel">Rachel did her undergraduate at Carleton University and is a first year Master's student in the Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science stream at York. She is currently co-supervised by Dr. Kohler and Dr. [Erez Freud](https://freud.lab.yorku.ca/). She is interested in understanding how low-level visual cues (symmetry, color, numeracy, motion, etc.) contribute to complex processes such as object recognition and spatial awareness. Making use of both neuroimaging and behavioral methods, she hopes to develop a richer understanding of how simple visual qualities can come together as rich, meaningful information in the brain. Rachel's research interests are heavily motivated by her love of painting, film, and graphic design. Rachel was awarded a [scholarship from VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/opportunities/masters-scholarships/) that will support her Master's studies.

We are currently recruiting graduate students, and would also love to hear from undergraduate students at York who are interested in learning about using EEG and functional MRI to study the human visual system.
