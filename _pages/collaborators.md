<p class="box-body"><img class="small-image" src="/assets/people/efreud.png" alt="Erez">Erez is another recent addition to the [Center for Vision Research](http://cvr.yorku.ca/). He joined York University as an Assistant Professor in 2018. His interests in object perception and mid- to high-level vision are closely aligned with the KVNL, so it was natural to begin collaborating as soon as Peter Kohler arrived at York. Erez is a co-advisor to Rachel Moreau and our two labs are currently doing joint lab meetings. More information is available on the Freud lab [website](https://www.freud.lab.yorku.ca/).

Tony has pioneered the use of steady-state visual-evoked potentials to study all aspects of visual perception and development for decades, and continues to drive the field forward. Peter Kohler worked under Tony as a post-doc for several years, and continues to benefit from his insights through collaborations and discussions.
