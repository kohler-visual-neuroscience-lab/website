<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/efreud.png" alt="Erez Freud">Erez is another recent addition to the [Center for Vision Research](http://cvr.yorku.ca/). He joined York University as an Assistant Professor in 2018. His interests in object perception and mid- to high-level vision are closely aligned with the KVNL, so it was natural to begin collaborating as soon as Peter Kohler arrived at York. Erez is a co-advisor to Rachel Moreau and our two labs are currently doing joint lab meetings. More information is available on the Freud lab [website](https://www.freud.lab.yorku.ca/).

	<img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/sbosse.png" alt="Sebastian Bosse">Sebastian Bosse is a senior researcher with the Machine Learning group and the Image Video Coding group in the [Video Coding & Analytics Department](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/vca.html) at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications – Heinrich Hertz Institute](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en.html), in Berlin, Germany. Sebastian's major research interests are image and video compression, human visual perception for image communications, and neural correlates of perceived image quality and quality of experience, as well as signal processing. Peter Kohler met Sebastian when the latter was a visiting scholar at Stanford University, and then have had an ongoing collaboration since.

<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/tnorcia.png" alt="Tony Norcia">Tony is the head of the [Stanford Visual Neurodevelopment Lab](https://svndl.stanford.edu)  and a world leader in visual neuroscience. Tony has pioneered the use of steady-state visual-evoked potentials to study all aspects of visual perception and development for decades, and continues to drive the field forward. Peter Kohler worked under Tony as a post-doc for several years, and continues to benefit from his insights through collaborations and discussions.
