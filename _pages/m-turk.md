	Symmetry is a highly salient feature of the natural world, found in both plants and animals as well as human artifacts. The importance of symmetry for visual perception was first discovered by the Gestalt Psychologists in the early 20th century, and since then, a large literature has highlighted at least three potential contributions of symmetry to visual perception. (1) Symmetry involves the comparison of features from spatially distant parts of the visual field, which suggests a close relationship with global integration processes required for perceiving form and motion. (2) Because of the complex interplay of physical forces that govern pattern formation in nature, natural objects are often symmetric, which means that symmetry can serve as a powerful cue for the detection, recognition and classification of objects. (3) Symmetry can be used as an efficient coding strategy, where repeating image elements are represented in terms of symmetries, so that it is not necessary to code individual image elements.
