### Experiments used for teaching

#### Ebbinghaus
[Ebbinghaus size illusion experiment](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/ebbinghaus/ebbinghaus). Used in NRSC 2200 and PSYC 4260.

#### Object Recognition
[Experiment](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/NRSC_2200/koh_objects/experiments/hit_prototype) created by my colleague [Kohitij Kar](https://vital-kolab.org/) measuring core object recognition. Used in NRSC 2200.

#### Viewing Distance
[Experiment](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/viewing_distance/viewing_distance) measuring viewing distance based on the blind spot. Used in PSYC 4260.

#### Visual Search
Classic visual search experiments based on Treisman and Gelade (1980). Three versions: [Colour Search](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/visual_search/colour_search), [Shape Search](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/visual_search/shape_search) and [Conjunction Search](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/visual_search/conjunction_search). Used in PSYC 4260.

#### Stroop
Classic Stroop Experiment created by [Jason Steffener](https://github.com/steffejr) and minimally adapted by Prof. Kohler. Three versions: [Stroop Colour](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/Stroop/stroop_color), [Stroop Word](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/Stroop/stroop_word) and [Stroop Colour Word](https://https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/Stroop/stroop_colour_word). Used in PSYC 4260.

#### Cambridge Face Memory Task
Cambridge Face Memory Task based on Duchaine and Nakayama (2006). Two versions: [Upright Faces](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/cfmt/cfmt_upright) and [Inverted Faces](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/cfmt/cfmt_inverted). Used in PSYC 4260.

#### Corsi Task
[Corsi Task](https://www.kohlerlab.com/assets/teaching/experiments/corsi_task/corsi_task) adapted from the version by Rose-Marie Gibeau found [here](https://www.tqmp.org/RegularArticles/vol17-3/p299/). Used in PSYC 4260.


### Courses taught

#### NRSC 2200: Neuroscience Techniques
The goal of the course is to provide students with an overview of and exposure to experimentation techniques and methodologies in the fields of systems and cognitive, cellular and molecular, and computational and theoretical neuroscience. Emphasis is on hands-on experience: Through experiments and programming exercises students practice working with data collected using these techniques, and learn how to use the techniques to draw conclusions about the brain. Students write assignments throughout the course based on the experiments and exercises they do every week, and demonstrate their knowledge about the techniques, the experiment design, the current results and
the related theory. The final assignment takes the form of a ~20-minute presentation of a scientific article that uses one of the techniques discussed in the course, or a related technique, delivered by groups of students to the rest of the class.

#### PSYC 4260: Laboratory in Sensation and Perception
In this course students conduct a number of experiments that relate to and demonstrate concepts learned in Sensation and Perception (PSYC 2220) and other cognitive neuroscience courses. A core requirement is participation in exercises and online experiments. Students analyze data collected from all students and write assignments that demonstrate their knowledge about the experiments, ability to interpret the current results and connect it to relevant theory. The final assignment is based on experiments that the students design themselves, in groups, and takes the form of a research report following APA guidelines, describing the experiment and results.

#### PSYC 2240: Biological Basis of Behaviour
This course provides an introduction to the biological determinants of behavior, drawing upon classic and cutting-edge research in neuroscience. The students are given an overview of the structure of the central nervous system and learn how it relates to sensation, perception, movement, emotion, and neurocognitive functions. Relevant research and case studies is integrated with the material throughout the course to better illustrate brain-behavior relationships in healthy states and in the context of illness and injury.
