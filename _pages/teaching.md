<p class="box-body">
In this course students conduct a number of experiments that relate to and demonstrate concepts learned in Sensation and Perception (2220) and other cognitive neuroscience courses. A core requirement is participation in exercises and online experiments. Students will analyze data collected from all students and write assignments that demonstrate their knowledge about the experiments, ability to interpret the current results and connect it to relevant theory. The final assignment is based on experiments that the students will design themselves, in groups, and will take the form of a research report following APA guidelines, describing the experiment and results.
