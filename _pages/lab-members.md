She earned her Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from The University of Isfahan in Iran. Sara possesses valuable experience in neuroscience data analysis, and has utilized advanced machine learning and artifical intelligence methodologies to detect evidence of atypical neurodevelopment based on EEG data. Her current research aims to relate variability in scalp EEG to variability in cortical morphology, which will make it possible to more closely relate EEG-based biomarkers to differences in activity of cortical neurons.

<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/rmoreau.png" alt="RachelMoreau">Rachel did her undergraduate at Carleton University and is a first year Master's student in the Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science stream at York. She is currently co-supervised by Dr. Kohler and Dr. [Erez Freud](https://freud.lab.yorku.ca/). She is interested in understanding how low-level visual cues (symmetry, color, numeracy, motion, etc.) contribute to complex processes such as object recognition and spatial awareness. Making use of both neuroimaging and behavioral methods, she hopes to develop a richer understanding of how simple visual qualities can come together as rich, meaningful information in the brain. Rachel's research interests are heavily motivated by her love of painting, film, and graphic design. Rachel was awarded a [scholarship from VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/opportunities/masters-scholarships/) that supported her Master's studies.

She recently relocated to the University of Saskatchewan, but continues to volunteer in the lab on a remote basis. Her current research interests include the neural basis of visual working memory in relation to pattern and object recognition of symmetrical and asymmetrical generated images. She hopes to expand her understanding of how behavioural studies and neuroimaging are used for further conceptualization of the human visual system. Rachel enjoys the outdoors, playing piano, and reading science fiction.
