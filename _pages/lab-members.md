Yara joined the lab as an undergraduate student, working on a project using EEG to probe the spatial mechanisms that mediate visual responses to symmetries in textures. For her Master's thesis, she is building on this work using functional MRI, in a project that aims to relate symmetry sensitivity to the properties of receptive fields of distinct visual regions. Yara has presented her work at national and international conferences, including a talk at the Vision Sciences Society in Florida in 2023, for which she won the VSS travel award. In her free time Yara enjoys reading, exercising, and playing chess.</p>

<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/ssamet.png" alt="Shaya Samet">Shaya is a Master's student in the Psychology program. He graduated with a MA in 2025, and is now doing a second MA in Clinical Neuropsychology, supervised in by Prof. Shayna Rosenbaum. Before starting graduate school, he completed a Specialized Honours thesis under Prof. Kohler's supervision on the roles of perceptual load and object salience in inattentional blindness. He then did an Individual Research Project, where he contributed to a study on working memory and symmetry, and was trained in collecting high-density EEG data from adult and infant participants. All of this prepared him well for his first MA thesis project, where he used EEG to study how local and configural information contributes to shape perception. He continues to collaborate with the Kohler Visual Neuroscience Lab, and his second MA will further investigate the role of symmetry in working memory. Shaya has presented his work at national and international conferences, and won the 2nd place award for best poster presentation at the Lake Ontario Visionary Establishment Conference in 2023.</p>

<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/rmoreau.png" alt="RachelMoreau">Rachel did her undergraduate at Carleton University and is a first year Master's student in the Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science stream at York. She is currently co-supervised by Dr. Kohler and Dr. [Erez Freud](https://freud.lab.yorku.ca/). She is interested in understanding how low-level visual cues (symmetry, color, numeracy, motion, etc.) contribute to complex processes such as object recognition and spatial awareness. Making use of both neuroimaging and behavioral methods, she hopes to develop a richer understanding of how simple visual qualities can come together as rich, meaningful information in the brain. Rachel's research interests are heavily motivated by her love of painting, film, and graphic design. Rachel was awarded a [scholarship from VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/opportunities/masters-scholarships/) that supported her Master's studies.
