I have recently started adopting the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS; [Gorgolewski et al., 2016](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644) for my functional and structural MRI datasets. I am working on sharing my EEG data using the same format. This effort will help ensure that my datasets can easily be shared and analyzed by other researchers around the world, and goes hand in hand with sharing analysis code through github and other services, as part of my overall strategy towards open and and reproducible science. Links to my publicly available datasets are shown below.
