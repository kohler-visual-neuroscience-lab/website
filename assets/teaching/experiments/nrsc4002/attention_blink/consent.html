	<p><strong>Purpose of the Research:</strong> This study is run as part of the York University undergraduate course NRSC-4002. The goal of the course is to provide students with hands-on experience 
		in using behavioural methods to study the brain and mind.
		A key component of this course is to have students design online behavioural experiments that use a variety of different methods to 
		uncover new information about the mechanisms that enable perception and cognition. 
		You are now being asked to participate in one of those studies.
		Although the purpose of the study is primarily educational, the results may also be disseminated at academic conference and publications. This will help advance our understanding of the brain and mind
		and may ultimately improve treatment of brain disorders arising from illness or injury.</p>
		
	<p><strong>What You Will Be Asked to Do in the Research:</strong> Your participation will involve sitting in front of a computer screen and looking at displays consisting of pictures, geometric shapes, patterns or dots. 
		You will respond to the visual stimuli using your own mouse or keyboard, doing tasks related to the stimuli by following instructions given on the screen. The experiment is designed to allow you to take breaks and rest periods as needed.</p>

	<p><strong>Compensation:</strong> You will be compensated for your participation with URPP credit (1 credit per half hour). You will not incur costs for participating in this experiment.</p>

	<p><strong>Risks and Discomforts</strong>: Watching video displays presents a potential risk of inducing seizures in susceptible individuals. 
		Our video displays present no more risk of seizure than that associated with normal screen viewing activities such as television and computer monitors. 
		Approximately 1 in 5000 individuals is susceptible to this risk (Harding and Jeavons, 1994), although not all participants who are at 
		risk due to photosensitivity will actually have an event triggered by watching a video display. If you or a first degree relative has ever had seizures, you should not participate in the study. </p>

	<p>There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality of your data and personal information. 
		We address this risk by storing your data using a code that cannot be tied to your person, and by not storing any information that can be tied to your person.</p>

	<p>Otherwise, the risk to participants is minimal in behavioral experiments. At most, participants may find the testing too simple or too difficult and become frustrated. 
		Previous experience with these sorts of paradigms suggests that subjects can perform these tests reasonably well with minimal impact on them. </p>

	<p><strong>Benefits of the Research and Benefits to You</strong>: Participation in this study will give you hands-on experience with the structure of a behavioural experiment in the fields of 
		experimental psychology and neuroscience, and of the experience of participating in such an experiment. This has the potential to benefit your own learning experience. We encourage you to reflect 
		on how each part of the experiment felt, and what you might have done differently, after the experiment is done. We will also mention here that this experiment is an essential component of the 
		Neuroscience degree at York University and gives our Neuroscience students important hands-on experience with designing an experiment and collecting, analyzing and interpreting the resulting data. 
		This grounding will prepare the students to engage critically with experiments and data for the rest of their career, and thus has the potential to benefit the scientific/scholarly community, and society as a whole. </p>

	<p><strong>Voluntary Participation</strong>: Your participation in the study is completely voluntary and you may choose to stop participating at any time. 
		Your decision not to volunteer will not influence the nature of the ongoing relationship you may have with the researchers or study staff 
		and the nature of your relationship with York University either now, or in the future.</p>

	<p><strong>Withdrawal from the Study</strong>: You can stop participating in the study at any time, for any reason, if you so decide. 
		If you decide to stop participating, you will still be eligible to receive the promised credit for agreeing to be in the project. 
		Your decision to stop participating, or to refuse to answer particular questions, will not affect your relationship with the researchers, York University, or any other group associated with this project. 
		If you withdraw from the study, all associated data collected will be immediately destroyed wherever possible.</p>

	<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: All information obtained during the study will be held in strict confidence to the fullest extent possible by law. 
		In no case will your personal information be shared with any other individuals or groups without your expressed written consent. 
		Your behavioral data will be archived indefinitely on secure computer servers and may, in an anonymized form that cannot be connected to you, 
		be used for teaching purposes, be presented at meetings, published, shared with other scientific researchers or used in future studies. 
		Your name or other identifying information will not be used in any publication or teaching materials without your specific permission. 
		Note that the data obtained in the experiment might be uploaded to an open external repository to promote collaborative scientific efforts. 
		The data will be anonymized, and your identity will not be revealed. 
		The data collected in this research project may be used – in an anonymized form - by members of the research team in subsequent research investigations exploring similar lines of inquiry. 
		Such projects will still undergo ethics review by the HPRC, our institutional REB. 
		Any secondary use of anonymized data by the research team will be treated with the same degree of confidentiality and anonymity as in the original research project.</p>
